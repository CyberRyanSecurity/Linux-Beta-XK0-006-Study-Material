**1.1 Explain basic Linux concepts**
### **1. Basic Boot Process**

The boot process is critical for initializing and starting the Linux operating system.

- **Bootloader:**
    - **Purpose:** The bootloader initializes the hardware and loads the kernel into memory.
    - **Examples:** GRUB (GNU GRUB), LILO.
    - **Configuration Files:** Found in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/etc/default/grub`, these files define settings such as the default kernel, timeout, and boot options.
    - **Key Commands:**
        - `update-grub`: Updates GRUB configuration.
        - `grub-install`: Installs the GRUB bootloader.
- **Kernel:**
    - **Definition:** The kernel is the core of the Linux OS, managing hardware, memory, and processes.
    - **Boot Parameters:** Options passed to the kernel during boot to modify behavior (e.g., `ro`, `quiet`, `single`).
    - **File Location:** Typically located in `/boot/vmlinuz-*`.
- **Initial RAM Disk (initrd):**
    - **Purpose:** A temporary filesystem loaded into RAM to prepare the system to mount the real root filesystem.
    - **Files:** Typically named `/boot/initrd.img-*`.
    - **Command:** `mkinitramfs` to generate initrd images.
- **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE):**
    - **Function:** Allows a computer to boot from a network server without local storage.
    - **Common Use:** Diskless systems or mass deployments.
    - **Tools:** `dnsmasq` for PXE boot setup.
