**1.1 Explain basic Linux concepts**
### **1. Basic Boot Process**

The boot process is critical for initializing and starting the Linux operating system.

- **Bootloader:**
    - **Purpose:** The bootloader initializes the hardware and loads the kernel into memory.
    - **Examples:** GRUB (GNU GRUB), LILO.
    - **Configuration Files:** Found in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/etc/default/grub`, these files define settings such as the default kernel, timeout, and boot options.
    - **Key Commands:**
        - `update-grub`: Updates GRUB configuration.
        - `grub-install`: Installs the GRUB bootloader.
- **Kernel:**
    - **Definition:** The kernel is the core of the Linux OS, managing hardware, memory, and processes.
    - **Boot Parameters:** Options passed to the kernel during boot to modify behavior (e.g., `ro`, `quiet`, `single`).
    - **File Location:** Typically located in `/boot/vmlinuz-*`.
- **Initial RAM Disk (initrd):**
    - **Purpose:** A temporary filesystem loaded into RAM to prepare the system to mount the real root filesystem.
    - **Files:** Typically named `/boot/initrd.img-*`.
    - **Command:** `mkinitramfs` to generate initrd images.
- **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE):**
    - **Function:** Allows a computer to boot from a network server without local storage.
    - **Common Use:** Diskless systems or mass deployments.
    - **Tools:** `dnsmasq` for PXE boot setup.
 
### **2. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**

The FHS defines the structure and purpose of directories in Linux. Key directories include:

- **`/`:** Root of the filesystem, containing all other directories.
- **`/bin`:** Essential user binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).
- **`/boot`:** Bootloader files, kernel images, and initrd images.
- **`/dev`:** Device files representing hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks).
- **`/etc`:** Configuration files for the system and applications.
- **`/home`:** User-specific data and configuration (e.g., `/home/user`).
- **`/lib`:** Libraries essential for binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **`/proc`:** Virtual filesystem providing kernel and process information.
- **`/sbin`:** System binaries for administrators (e.g., `reboot`, `iptables`).
- **`/tmp`:** Temporary files that are cleared on reboot.
- **`/usr`:** Secondary hierarchy for user applications, libraries, and binaries.
- **`/var`:** Variable files, including logs (`/var/log`), cache (`/var/cache`), and spool files (`/var/spool`).

 ### **3. Server Architectures**

Linux supports multiple hardware architectures, enabling flexibility in deployment:

- **AArch64:**
    - 64-bit ARM architecture.
    - Common in energy-efficient devices, such as smartphones and servers (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
- **RISC-V:**
    - Open-source, scalable architecture.
    - Focuses on simplicity and energy efficiency; increasingly popular in research and IoT devices.
- **x86:**
    - 32-bit architecture found in legacy PCs.
    - Limited memory addressing (up to 4 GB).
- **x86_64/AMD64:**
    - 64-bit architecture.
    - Supports larger memory (over 4 GB) and more efficient processing.
    - Standard in modern servers and desktops. 

### **4. Linux Distributions**

Linux distributions bundle the kernel with utilities, libraries, and package management tools.

- **RPM-Based:**
    - Uses RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) for package management.
    - Examples:
        - **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL):** Enterprise-focused with support.
        - **CentOS/AlmaLinux:** Free clones of RHEL.
        - **Fedora:** Community-driven with cutting-edge features.
    - Commands:
        - `rpm -qa`: Query installed packages.
        - `yum` or `dnf`: Advanced package management.
- **Debian-Based:**
    - Uses `dpkg` for package management.
    - Examples:
        - **Debian:** Stability-focused.
        - **Ubuntu:** User-friendly and widely used.
    - Commands:
        - `dpkg -l`: List installed packages.
        - `apt`: High-level package management tool.

### **5. Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

The GUI system in Linux enhances user interaction through graphical elements.

- **Display Managers:**
    - Handle user logins and desktop session management.
    - Examples: GDM (GNOME), LightDM, SDDM (KDE).
- **Window Managers:**
    - Control window appearance and behavior.
    - Examples: GNOME Shell (full desktop), i3 (tiling manager), Openbox (minimalist).
- **X Server:**
    - The traditional display server for rendering graphics.
    - Tool: `xrandr` for managing displays.
- **Wayland:**
    - Modern replacement for X Server.
    - Focuses on security and performance.
    - Adoption: GNOME, KDE.

### **6. Software Licensing**

Linux is built on diverse licensing models, defining how software can be used and distributed.

- **Open Source Software:**
    - Source code is publicly available.
    - Allows modification and redistribution.
    - Examples: Apache, Linux kernel.
- **Free Software:**
    - Emphasizes user freedom (to run, modify, share).
    - Governed by organizations like the Free Software Foundation.
    - Examples: GNU utilities.
- **Proprietary Software:**
    - Closed-source with restricted use.
    - Examples: Some device drivers, commercial software.
- **Copyleft:**
    - Requires derivative works to use the same license as the original.
    - Example: GNU General Public License (GPL).
